      " Match Closing with bs via email: Hi Mai, Thanks so much for sending this over. And thank you for arranging the match closing; I know it's not ideal. Please see my answers below -- What were the highlights of your match? Meeting a smart, funny young person! Any regrets or disappointments in your match? No! What are your expectations for contact after the match is closed? Will you continue contact through phone, email, etc? As a reminder, once your match is closed all future contact is no longer under the supervision of Big Brothers Big Sisters. I don't know. I am open to further contact, though. Do you have any concerns with your Little participating in a new match? No! Overall, I had a good experience with my Little and enjoyed being a Big. The only piece of feedback that I really have for the experience is that I wish the Bigs would have received a bit more training. For example, how to deal with adolescents and the different situations they are in with their friends, how to form relationships with the Little's family, etc. Thanks again Mai! With warm regards, B_first_name Msc emailed the following back: Hi B_first_name, Thanks for completing the closing and for the feedback! I will contact L_first_name and Germaine to do closing as well. I wish you well as you begin your motherhood journey. Thanks for all that you have done for L_first_name and the BBBS program.\n"
